# üß† MindMeld ‚Äî AI-Powered Context-Aware Research Workspace

A workspace where you can dump all your messy notes, PDFs, links, and ideas, and the LLM becomes your research partner ‚Äî remembering everything, connecting dots, and generating insights automatically.

## Core Concept

You throw in:
- Articles
- Meeting notes
- Screenshots
- Audio transcriptions

The LLM processes & indexes everything in a semantic vector database.

Then you can:
- Ask deep questions across all your materials (‚ÄúWhat do these reports say about Q3 customer churn?‚Äù)
- Get summaries, timelines, comparisons, and trend analysis.
- Auto-generate presentations or reports from your knowledge dump.

## Backend Stack

### Ingestion Pipeline

- Python / Node microservice to accept text, PDFs, images (OCR with Tesseract or Vision API).
- Audio ‚Üí Text via Whisper.

### Storage & Retrieval

- PostgreSQL for metadata.
- Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or open-source like Milvus) for semantic search.

### AI Orchestration
- LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic) for question answering & summarization.
- LangChain / LlamaIndex for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

### Background Workers (Celery or Kafka) to:

- Auto-tag and cluster notes.
- Build topic maps.
- Extract entities and relationships.

## Frontend Features

### React / Next.js app
- Drag & drop note upload.
- Search bar that‚Äôs ‚ÄúGoogle + Chat‚Äù for your own data.
- Knowledge graph view: see how documents connect.
- Highlight-to-ask: Select any text snippet and ask the LLM for context or deeper explanation.

### Multi-modal search
- Type questions
- Upload an image or chart and ask ‚ÄúExplain this‚Äù
- Speak into mic for quick queries
